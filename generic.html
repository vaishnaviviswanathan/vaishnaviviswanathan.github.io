								<h3><u>Mehndika ~ Henna</u></h3>
								<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehndi">Mehndi</a> is a form of body art that is created wit the leaves of a naturally earth grown henna plant that leaves a dark orange/brown/red stain on the body on application, temporarily. It is a tradition in India for the women to adorn their hands with henna designs for various festivals. I am a talented henna artist and have been practising it for around 15 years now, on people who offer to adorn their hands with henna. Each time I draw a design, it is different. I practise all forms of designs, from Indian to Arabic designs. I have been an Henna Artist for marriages and engagements back in India. I often like to draw pretty intricate designs.</p>

								<h3><u>Application</u></h3>
								<p>The leaves of the henna plant is finely grinded and mixed with essential oils like eucalyptus to help it leave a strong orange stain on the body that would last for minimum of 1 week. Once the consistency is smooth, it is put into a cone shaped plastic bag (like a frosting bag) for drawing designs. Once the paste dries off, a mixture of lemon and sugar is appied on top of the design to get a bold stain. Once the entire art work dries off, the paste cracks and can be withered off from the skin that would leave a fresh ornage stain initially that turns red/brown depending on the quality of the henna paste.</p>

								<h3><u>AID Colorado | Henna Artist | Voluntary service</u></h3>
								<p><a href="http://aid-colorado.weebly.com/">AID Colorado</a> Organization provides support to children for education from families who are in need. I was an Henna artist to support for this cause during all the Indian Festivals organised at the University of Colorado Boulder. Being brought up in India, a poverty stricken country, I have seen many children, elderly and physically challenged people on the streets finding it hard to get good food. Even though, it is possible to do them a needy favor, an individual person cannot afford to help a huge crowd of people in need. So, the only possible way to support a huge crowd is through collected efforts of like minded people who are driven to help people in need in different ways. I found such possibility in AID-Colorado when I heard about them at the University of Colorado Boulder when I was pursuing my Masters Degree. I wanted to put my talent to use for this cause. At the end of the day doing this kind of small, yet a good deed makes me feel satisfied and useful.</p>
